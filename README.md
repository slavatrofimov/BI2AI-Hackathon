# Welcome to the BI2AI Hack

This is a challenge-based hack. It's NOT step-by-step. Don't worry, you will do great whatever your level of experience! You will be guided through different tasks to implement comprehensive analytics by leveraging Power BI, Cognitive Servies, and Azure Machine Learning to deliver an AI enabled analytics solution.  This exercise is designed to take you, the business intelligence practitioner, and introduce you to a variety of concepts around artificial intelligence and machine learning.  We realize that there is a lot to becoming a data scientist, and upskilling in this area can be an intimidating task.  The goal of this Hack is to give you practical areas where you can gain value out of predictive technologies today and amplify the value of the analytics solutions.

## **Introduction**

Our solution begins with an existing data warehouse.  Adventure Works needs to transition their reporting to Power BI to better empower their business users to gain insights from their data with less IT involvement in the reporting process. This endeavor begins as a fairly basic implementation of their data model in Power BI, but quickly devolves into a hybrid data architecture, and ultimately results in a variety of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tasks to gain better insights from the data.  

## Technologies
